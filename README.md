### **Problem Description:**

**Display Images Using Pixabay API**

---

Build the solution in either:

1. Android
2. Flutter
3. Web

### **Task:**

Your task is to build a **simple solution** in either **Android/Flutter/Web** that fetches and displays a set of images from the Pixabay API. Pixabay provides a free library of high-quality images that you will retrieve and display in your app.

---

### **Core Requirements:**

### 1. **Display Images:**

- The app should automatically fetch and display a set of images from the Pixabay API.
- These images should be shown in a **grid or list format**.
- Each image should be **clickable**, opening a detailed view with:
    - A larger version of the image.
    - Additional information such as the image title or author.

### 2. **API Integration:**

- Integrate with the Pixabay API (you can sign up for a free API key on Pixabay) to fetch images.
- Ensure that API responses and errors are handled properly (e.g., display a message if there’s an issue connecting to the API).

### 3. **Basic UI:**

- Display the images in a **clean and simple layout**.
- Ensure the app is **responsive** so that images display properly across different screen sizes.

---

### **Extras to Excel:**

For additional recognition in the selection process, consider adding the following features:

### 1. **Search Option:**

- Add a search bar where users can search for images based on keywords (e.g., "nature", "technology").
- This makes the app more dynamic by fetching images related to the user's search term.

### 2. **Image Download Option:**

- Add a feature allowing users to download images to their device.

### 3. **Favorite/Bookmark Images:**

- Enable users to mark images as favorites and store them locally.
- Users can view these images later, even offline.

### 4. **Image Sharing:**

- Add the ability to share images via social media or messaging apps directly from the app.

---

### **Evaluation Criteria:**

### 1. **API Integration:**

- Ensure proper communication with the Pixabay API to fetch and display images.

### 2. **UI/UX Design:**

- The app should be **visually appealing** and **easy to use**.

### 3. **Error Handling:**

- Handle API errors gracefully, such as displaying appropriate error messages for network issues.

### 4. **Creativity and Extra Features:**

- Bonus points for implementing any of the extra features to enhance the app’s functionality and user experience.
